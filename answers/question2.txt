First, we have to figure out the size of a pokeball.
Assuming a pokeball is a sphere, we only have to know the radius of it.

Note: The formula for a sphere is pir^2

Then, we need to figure out the total volume of the Coit Tower.
According to google (wiki), the height of Coit Tower is 210 foot, the area of it is 74,050 ft^2
Therefore, we can have a rough estimate of Coit Tower having a volume of 210 * 74050 = 15,550,500 ft^3
After further research, https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pokeball mentioned about poke ball having the size roughly of a baseball.

Baseball has a volume of 12.32 cubic inches, which is ~0.007 cubic foot.

Therefore, a rough estimate of how many pokeballs are in the tower is 22215000000.
